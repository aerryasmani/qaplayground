# Project Title

QA Playground

## Description

This project to showcases my practical test automation skills acquired through the QA Playground (https://qaplayground.dev/) exercise using Pytest and Selenium. It demonstrates finding and verifying elements to solidify automation concepts.
As for now I only completed the mini web app dynamic table and will complete the rest of the mini web apps in the future

## Potential Future Explorations
*Consider automating other QA Playground exercises to further refine my skills.
*Explore handling more complex scenarios like pagination, sorting, and filtering within the mini web apps
*Experiment with different locators and strategies for enhanced robustness.
